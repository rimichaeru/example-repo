# example-repo
Cloning repo, editing, and using with git.

NEVER CLONE A REPO INTO A REPO

 - git clone repo-url

  - modify / edit a file = MAKE SURE YOU SAVE
  - git add -A = adds from working area to staging area
  - git commit -m "message" = adds from staging area to local repo
  - git push origin main = pushes local repo to remote repo

  - git status = check mismatches between work, staging, local, origin
